html page  for TOPs recipe project
Basically revision on my end but maybe i'll learn something new

# Post first commit 
Yeah so basically learnt nothing new
I might stylise this page in the future because it's hella ugly. Very bare bones page as well - no JS included/needed so that's cool it makes it easy to style.
